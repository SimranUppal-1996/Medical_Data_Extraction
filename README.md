# Medical_Data_Extraction

Medical data extraction is an exciting project! 
As the name suggests, useful data is extracted from medical data pdfs. In the guided project, two types of pdfs are used:
1 - Prescription 
2 - Patient Details 
The following steps covers all main and important tasks:
1 - Converting pdfs to images
2 - Scanning the images using basic Computer Vision concepts.
3 - Converting the images to text
4 - Extracting useful information from the text using regular expressions
5 - Firstly, jupyter notebooks are used to work on small blocks. Then all these blocks are associated together and python code is written for each greater task.
6 - Fast API is used as a server and Postman is used as a front end application.

Apart from the guided tasks, I have personally included the following tasks to make this project unique and more challenging!
1 - Two more types of medical documents are involved:
a) Vaccination Record
b) Medical History
2 - All the steps mentioned in the guided project are applied on these pdfs as well but also some additional ones as stated below:
a) Advanced Computer Vision concepts like 'Region of interest' are implemented on the pdf of medical history.
b) All the python code files are altered to  adjust these two pdfs.
